# Kickstarter Analysis
Analysis of kickstarter data from Jan 2016 to Dec 2019.

This project focuses on identifying factors that contributed to the performance of projects listed on Kickstarter.com. Campaign success is the main drive of the project, allowing for flexible segmentation of data, based on independent variables. 

Categorization can also be extended to the furthest extents of the dataset, in search for trends. Forecasting is also enabled through sufficient segmentation. However, it should be noted that underlying conditions and factors may affect forecasting and limit the application of this analysis to the dataset's timeframe.

Due to the nature of this project, no license is provided.
